# Docs are boring, but very important

If you want to learn anything fast, or deeply, rote memorization is an important step in the process.

Flashcards are one great way to pound basic bits of information into your brain, and retain massive volumes of information. Flashcards aren't a panacea for deeper understanding, but figuring out how all the puzzle pieces fit together becomes a heck of a lot easier when you know all the pieces.

This is exactly where `*-docs-as-flashcards` comes in. I've taken the documentation and converted the critical information into a flashcard format, so that you and/or your team can study-up as quickly and efficiently as possible, then go off and confidently use these technologies to achieve what you've set out to achieve.

Anki by far the most popular free and open-source flashcard app around, available for both desktop and mobile. Anki is how `*-docs-as-flashcards`-related flashcard decks can be used.
